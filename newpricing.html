## 🔸 VALUE POSITIONING EXAMPLE

If a client builds their own plan with:  
- Registered Office (£11.95/mo)  
- 2 Directors (£12.95 x2)  
- Mail Forwarding (£17.95)  

That’s **£55.80/month (~£670/year)**  
➡ The **Business Plan** gives it for **£249/year**, saving **over 60%**.  
This makes the mid-tier plan *the obvious, high-value choice* — classic **Hormozi-style “no-brainer” pricing**.
